# Nosee-console
A simple Web based alert monitoring console for Nosee.

**Warning: Heavy WIP!**

What is it?
-----------

It's a simple HTTP server collecting [Nosee](https://github.com/Xfennec/nosee)
alerts and providing a Web interface.

It uses a WebSocket to get new alerts and updates in realtime, and plays notification
sounds. Nosee-console is well suited for a permanent display.

Web interface on a Raspberry Pi Zero. It's powered by the TV and
boots directly to Chromium "kiosk mode":
