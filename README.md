# Nosee-console
A simple Web based alert monitoring console, mostly for Nosee.

**Warning: Heavy WIP!**

What is it?
-----------

It's a simple HTTP server collecting [Nosee](https://github.com/Xfennec/nosee)
alerts and providing a Web interface. While it was developped with Nosee in
mind, it provides a HTTP REST-like interface, so you may interface it with
virtually anything else.

It uses a WebSocket to get new alerts and updates in realtime, and plays
notification sounds. Nosee-console is well suited for a permanent display.

Web interface on a Raspberry Pi Zero. It's powered by the TV and boots directly
to Chromium "kiosk mode":

How do you build it?
--------------------

If you have Go installed:

	go get github.com/Xfennec/nosee-console

You will then be able to launch the binary located in you Go "bin" directory.
(since Go 1.8, `~/go/bin` if you haven't defined any `$GOPATH`)

The project is still too young to provide binaries. Later. (and `go get` is so powerfulâ€¦)

As a reminder, you can use the `-u` flag to update the project and its dependencies  if
you don't want to use `git` for that.

	go get -u github.com/Xfennec/nosee-console

How do you use it?
------------------

Build it, run it with no CLI option, and point your browser
to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and that's it.
Of course, you must then send your alerts to this running console, see below.

### REST-like API

The endpoint is `/alerts`. A `GET` will return an JSON-encoded arrays.

A `POST` will allow you to send a new alert or update a previous alert to
switch its type from BAD to GOOD.

Nosee provides a [ready to use sample script](https://github.com/Xfennec/nosee/blob/master/etc/scripts/alerts/nosee-console.sh)
where you just have to update the console URL. You may use this script as
a reference if needed.

This part of the documentation is very sparse, but the API is a Work In Progress.

### Misc.

The server now implement persistance, you can restart the server without
losing current alerts. See `nosee-console-alerts.json` and `-save-path` option,
and feel free to delete the file for a fresh start with no alert.

I will soon add a supervisord script to the repository, too. (and then a systemd unit)
